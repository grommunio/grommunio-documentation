Administration
##############

This chapter includes details on how to administrate components of
grommunio with the available toolset.

grommunio admin UI (AUI)
========================

After successfully installing the grommunio Appliance, you can access the UI
through your browser on port 8080 (8443 with https soon).

Since you most likely set a password for admin UI while installing the
Appliance, you can immediately use these credentials to login.

.. image:: _static/img/login.png
   :alt: grommunio login

To navigate through the UI, simply use the drawer on the left side of the page.

Dashboard
---------

After a successful login, you can see the dashboard with live data of the
machine grommunio runs on.


Antispam
~~~~~~~~

Since grommunio has its own antispam service, according data can be displayed
in the Dashboard.

the detailed view. Now change the status from deactivated to activated.

.. image:: _static/img/activate_domain.png
   :alt: editing domain


Users
-----

If at least one domain exists in the database, users can be added to a domain.
To show existing users of a domain, navigate to the domain view in the drawer (`Domains` tab).

Click on a domain to expand available sub-pages and click on `Users`, which
will redirect you to the list of users of this domain. If you just installed
grommunio or added the domain, the list will be empty.

Alternatively, to see all users across all domains, click on `Global users` in the drawer.


Adding a user
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add a new user, click the blue `NEW USER` button to open the form dialog:

.. image:: _static/img/add_user.png
   :alt: adding a user

The following properties can be set:

- Mode: Normal or shared user

Editing a user
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To edit an existing user, click on a user in the list to open the detailed view
of a user.

.. image:: _static/img/edit_user.png
   :alt: editing a user

There are 10 main categories of user properties:

- Account: RPC/HTTP (Outlook Anywhere), MAPI/HTTP, IMAP, POP3 etc.
  configuration 
- Alt names: Alternative usernames to log into mail-clients with (does not have to be an e-mail address)
- Details: MAPI props
- Contact: Additional MAPI props
- Roles: Roles of the user
- SMTP: Additional e-mails for this user (aliases) and forwarding rules
- Permission: Select users which have special permissions for this user's mailbox
- OOF: Out of office settings
- Fetchmail: Configuration to fetch mails from other servers via fetchmail
- Mobile devices: List of user's mobile devices (via MDM)
- Sync policy: MDM sync policy (specifically for this user)


Account
^^^^^^^

The following properties can be edited:

- Username
- Mode: Mailbox mode, select between a normal user, a suspended user and a shared mailbox
- Type: Type of user
- Homeserver: Server on which the user's data is stored
- Language: Store language of the user (does not effect the language of the UI)
- Used space
   - Send quota limit: Maximum size of the mailbox before sending messages is
     blocked
   - Receive quota limit: Maximum size of the mailbox before message reception
     is blocked
   - Storage quota limit: Maximum size of the mailbox before storing (any kind
     of) objects is blocked
- Hide user from: Hide user from specific user lists (e.g. the global address list)
- Automatic processing of meeting requests: Trivial
- Create grommunio-chat user: Creates a grommunio-chat account for this user. If this checkbox is disabled, there is no grommunio-chat team for this domain.
- grommunio-chat admin permission: Gives administrative permissions for grommunio-chat to this user's grommunio-chat account.
- grommunio-chat permissions: Grants grommunio-chat admin permissions
- Allow SMTP sending: Allows the user to send e-mails via SMTP
- Allow password changes: Allows the user to change his/her password
- Allow POP3/IMAP logins: Allows logins via POP3 or IMAP
- Hide from GAL: Hides the user from the Global Address List
- Allow Chat/Meet/Files/Archive: Allows access to respective feature

Note that, because a message needs to exist internally before it can
be sent, the storage quota limit is also relevant for sending. Conversely,
for reception, the storage quota limit must allow storing messages.
(Thus, the storage quota should always be more than receive quota, and more than
send quota.)

To change the current password of the user, click `Change password` next to the
username.
You will be prompted to set and repeat the new password.


User & Contact
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Common MAPI props. These are self-explanatory.


Roles
^^^^^

Roles of the user, which can be edited with the autocompleting textfield

.. image:: _static/img/user_roles.png
   :alt: editing a user


SMTP
^^^^

User aliases:. Edit the textfield to edit an alias, click `ADD E-MAIL` to add or
click the delete icon to delete an alias.

E-Mail forward: Select forward type (CC or Redirect) and the destination e-mail.

.. image:: _static/img/user_smtp.png
   :alt: editing a user


Permissions
^^^^^^^^^^^

This dialog allows giving other user identities certain permissions at the
mailbox level.

* Delegates: Users in the delegate list may exercise the "send on behalf"
  feature, i.e. send messages with a ``From:`` line containing the delegator's
  identity. *The use of delegation is recorded in messages.*
* Send As (also known as Impersonation): Users in the send-as list may send
  messages with a ``From:`` line containing the delegator's identity. It is
  similar to delegation, but the use of delegation is *not* recorded in
  messages. Send-As overrides and masks Send-On-Behalf, because SA/SOB
  permission is only known server-side and MAPI clients have no way to choose
  between the two.
* “Full permissions”: Users in this list will be treated like the mailbox
  owner and not be subject to permission checks when reading or writing
  folder or message objects.

.. image:: _static/img/user_permissions.png
   :alt: editing a user


OOF
^^^

Out of office settings (auto-reply messages).

- ``icon``: The icon in the collapsed drawer
- ``background``: The background image in light mode
- ``backgroundDark``: The background image in dark mode

Each of these keys must be an URL to an image file.

.. image:: _static/img/design.png
   :alt: design

As you can see, it is not necessary to overwrite every image, but the hostnames need to be accurate.

Click on the `Show config` button to display the ``customImages`` config object,
which needs to be copied into ``/etc/grommunio-admin-common/config.json`` on the server.


Application links
-----------------

.. image:: _static/img/topbar.png

.. image:: _static/img/updates.png
   :alt: updates


LDAP
----

It it possible to synchronise users from external user directories using LDAP.
To configure LDAP, click on `LDAP` in the drawer, which will redirect you to
the LDAP form to define a global LDAP configuration.
This config can be overwritten for each individual organisation.
To do so, navigate to `Organisations` and open the detailed view of an organisation.
Flip the `Override global LDAP config` switch and set a config according to the following specification.

.. important::
   Please note that configuration changes are not automatically applied to the
   services already running. Make sure to restart the services to be able to
   pick up the LDAP authentication first.

After applying a new LDAP configuration, the services are intentionally not automatically
restarted as this would result into possibly inconvenient downtime if existing internal users
are already used by the authentication manager (authmgr). Services can either be restarted
through admin UI in the dashboard section or via systemd directly:

``systemctl restart gromox-{http,zcore,pop3,delivery,delivery-queue,midb,imap}``


Availability
~~~~~~~~~~~~

`LDAP not available` means the LDAP config isn't set up correctly or the server
can't be reached.
If you want to disable LDAP manually, flip the `LDAP enabled` switch.

.. image:: _static/img/ldap_switch.png
   :alt: LDAP switch


Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Through this form, you create a `ldap.yaml` file, which configures an LDAP
connection.

Properties are split into the following categories:

- LDAP Server
- Attribute Configuration
- Custom Mapping

To save a configuration, click `Save` at the bottom or click `Delete Config` to
delete the current configuration.


LDAP Server
~~~~~~~~~~~

The following properties are available:

- LDAP Server (server): Address of the LDAP server to connect to
- LDAP Bind User (bindUser): DN of the user to perform initial bind with
- StartTLS: Whether to utilize the StartTLS mechanism to secure the connection
- LDAP Base DN (baseDn): Base DN to use for user search


Authentication manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Primary authentication mechanism

- Always MySQL (default): MySQL authentication
- Always LDAP: LDAP authentication
- Automatic: The choice between LDAP/MySQL occurs dynamically, depending on
  whether the user was imported from LDAP originally.


Attribute Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following properties are available:

- LDAP Templates (templates): Template to prefill any fields below. Available
  are:
   - OpenLDAP
   - ActiveDirectory
- LDAP Filter (filters): LDAP search filter to apply to user lookup
- Unique Identifier Attribute (objectID): Name of an attribute that uniquely
  identifies an LDAP object
- LDAP Username Attribute (username): Name of the attribute that corresponds to
  the username (e-mail address)
- LDAP Default Quota (defaultQuota): Storage quota of imported users if no
  mapping exists
- LDAP Display Name Attribute (displayName): Name of the attribute that
  contains the name


LDAP Search Attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Controls which attributes the "Search in LDAP" functionality will look at when
searching using an arbitrary search string.


Custom Mapping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

LDAP attribute -> PropTag mapping to use for LDAP import.
Any mappings specified take precedence over active templates.

You can create a list of `(Name, Value)` pairs

- Name: Name of the PropTag the attribute maps to
- Value: Value of the PropTag the attribute maps to


User import and synchronisation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To import/sync users from all domains, you have to have SystemAdmin permissions.
If you do, click on `IMPORT USERS` or `SYNC USERS`.
This will import/sync all users of all domains.

If you don't have these permissions, you can import/sync users for your domain.
To do that, navigate to the user list(s) of your domain(s).

Importing users will synchronise all already imported users and also import new
ones.
Synchronising will only do the first.


Domain user import and synchronisation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the users list, you can either import/sync all users of this domain by
clicking `Import/Sync ldap users`.
If you want to import specific users, you can do the following:


User import
~~~~~~~~~~~

Click on `Search in ldap` to open a list view of ldap users.
Simply enter a username at the searchbar and click the import icon of a user to
import.

.. image:: _static/img/search_ldap.png
   :alt: search ldap

There is the option to force the import. If checked, an existing user with this
usename in the grommunio database will be overwritten.

.. image:: _static/img/import_user.png
   :alt: importing a user


You can sync these specific users by clicking on them in the list view and
clicking the `Sync` button in the detailed view (only for LDAP users).


Detaching a user
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to modify an ldap user, you need to detach it from ldap.
You can achieve this by clicking `Detach` in the detailed user view.
This essentially removes the synchronisation until forcefully overwriting the
user via another import.


Removing orphaned users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a user was removed from the ldap directory, the imported user will be
orphaned.
To show and/or delete currently orphaned users, click on `Check ldap users`.

.. image:: _static/img/orphaned_users.png
   :alt: orphaned users



DB Configuration
----------------

It is possible to create config files in the database to manage services.
Every config file manages exactly one file and includes lines of `(key, value)`
pairs.

This creates a hierarchical structure:

- ServiceA
   - FileA
      - foo=bar
   - FileB
      - test=example
      - test2=example2
- ServiceB
   - FileC
      - key=value


Adding a file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A useful example would be to configure a relayhost in postfix:

.. image:: _static/img/add_file.png
   :alt: adding a file


Editing a file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To edit a file, click on the service the file belongs to.
This will open a detailed view of the service with a list of its files.
Click on a file to open its detailed view and edit the `(key, value)` pairs to
your needs.

   :alt: editing a file

Click `Save` to confirm or `Cancel` to discard your changes.


Deleting a file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To delete a file, click on the service the file belongs to.
This will open a detailed view of the service with a list of its files.
Click on the trash icon of a file to delete it and confirm.


Configuring grommunio-dbconf
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`grommunio-dbconf` is an internal service, that will execute actions/commands
when configs change.
These actions can be specified for every service separately.

Adding a grommunio-dbconf file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Actions to be executed when a config of a service `<servicename>` changes,
need to be set in the file `grommunio-dbconf/<servicename>`.

There are pre-made commands to set for either key, file or service changes.
Those can be found on the `Commands` tab.

.. image:: _static/img/file_commands.png
   :alt: file commands

If a command doesn't exist, the next lower level command will be executed
(service -> file -> key).

For example, you could configure `postfix` changes like this:

.. image:: _static/img/add_dbconf.png
   :alt: adding dbconf

This will, among else, restart the service if the service config changes.


Servers
-------

If grommunio is running on a distributed system, the list of servers can be added in this view.
It is possible to specify the selection policy for user distribution.
You can select from:

- round-robin: Always use the server on which a user has *not* been added for the longest time (in a circle-like manner).
- balanced: Put new user on server with least workload
- first: Always use the first server
- last: Always use the last server
- random: Pick a random server

Adding a server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add a new server, click the blue `NEW SERVER` button to open the form dialog:

.. image:: _static/img/add_server.png
   :alt: add server

The following properties can be set:

- Hostname (required): Internal server hostname
- Extname (required): Hostname for external access (DNS-Name)


Editing a server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To edit an existing server, click on a server in the list to open the detailed view.

.. image:: _static/img/edit_server.png
   :alt: edit server

Simply change attributes to your needs, then click `Save` on the bottom to save
your changes.


Logs
----

Click on `Logs` in the drawer, which will redirect you to the list of available
logs.
Usually, you will see a list of grommunio/gromox services, which `journalctl`
logs you can view here.

.. image:: _static/img/logs.png
   :alt: logs

Click on the uparrow to show previous logs.
Click on the the refresh button to fetch new logs or toggle the autorefresh
switch to automatically refresh logs of the selected service every 5 seconds.
Click on a log line to fetch every log *after* the timestamp of the clicked
line.


Mail queue
----------

Click on `Mail queue` in the drawer, which will redirect you to the view of the
current postfix and gromox mail queue.

.. image:: _static/img/mailQ.png
   :alt: mailQ

These lists will update automatically every 10 seconds.


Actions
~~~~~~~

Select table rows by clicking the checkboxes. Mail queue actions will be used on the selected entries.

The actions are:

- Flush: Try to continue mail processing
- Requeue: Remove mail from queue and add queue the same mail as new entry
- Delete: Permanently remove mail from queue


Tasks
-----

Click on `Mail queue` in the drawer, which will redirect you to the Tasks view.

Tasks are created for operations which could potentially take a long time.
Currently, this includes LDAP sync and folder deletion.
If one of these operations take too long, a background task is created, which can be viewed in this table.

.. image:: _static/img/tasks.png
   :alt: tasks

In case the internal task processor is not running, it can be started manually by clicking the `Start server` button.

Further task details can be seen in the task details view, by clicking on a task in the table.


Mobile devices
--------------

Click on `Mobile devices` in the drawer, which will redirect you to the list of
synchronised mobile devices.
This view is a recreation of the grommunio-sync-top CUI.

.. image:: _static/img/sync.png
   :alt: sync

The view will update the devices every 2 seconds.
On the top, you can specify filters for the table, like text-based search or
activity of devices.


Sync policies
-------------

The synchronisation behavior of devices is specified by the sync policies,
which are a set of rules.
When a user logs into an account, these policies will be applied to the device
and updated as soon as the policy is changed.
It is not possible to change the policies globally, but per domain (all users
of a domain) or per user.
To change the policy for all users of a domain, navigate to the list of domains
and click on the domain for which you want to change the policy.
Under the `Sync policy` tab, you can see the current rules.

.. image:: _static/img/syncPolicies.png
   :alt: sync

Blue checkboxes, sliders or textfields indicate deviations from the default
policy, grey ones match it.

To specify specific rules for a user, navigate to list of users and click on
the user for whom you want to change the policy.
Just like domain-specific policies, current rules are displayed under the `Sync
policy` tab.
Again, blue checkboxes, sliders or textfields indicate deviations from the
`domain` policy of this user, grey ones match it.


Live Status
-----------

Click on `Live Status` in the drawer, which will redirect you to the live,
realtime view of the grommunio web services. Any HTTP request shows up in live
status, including MAPI/HTTP, EAS, EWS and other requests made. All connections
other than grommunio Groupware, e.g. Chat and Files are also viewable and can
be tracked by the entrypoint URL in the list.

.. image:: _static/img/livestatus.png
   :alt: live status

At the top you can select one of the available vhosts and the update interval.
