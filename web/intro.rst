Introduction
############

grommunio Web is the web-baseed interface of the grommunio software suite. It
combines a set of applications which allow easy usage for everyday users.
grommunio Web can be accessed through a modern web browser and has all the
important and daily usable tools like e-mail, calendar, contacts, notes &
tasks, and integration with grommunio Meet and others.

Altogether, grommunio Web offers integrated advanced tools for teamwork and
professional collaborations, such as chat and web meetings. Since grommunio Web
is easy configurable, administrators and developers can create new plugins and
integrate them into the interface at any time.

Requirements
############

grommunio Web can be accessed from a modern web browser. The currently
supported list of browsers of grommunio Web include, but are not limited to:

- Google Chrome (78+), including derivatives such as Brave Browser, Ungoogled
  and Iridium
- Mozilla Firefox (70+)
- Apple Safari (12.1+)
- Microsoft Edge (78+)

We recommend the use of a relatively recent version of the used browser. Next
to security reasons, this traditionally provides the best user experience
overall. While other browsers or other versions may also work, grommunio cannot
guarantee their function. If you encounter any issues, we recommend to get in
touch with support and open a support ticket so potential incompatibilities can
be investigated.
