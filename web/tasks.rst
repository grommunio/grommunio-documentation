============
Task Request
============

A task request is different from a normal task because you can assign it to someone else. When you click on Assign Task, a „To“ field appears where you can enter the person’s email address or choose it from the Address Book.

When the assignee finishes the task, it can be marked as completed. A “Task Completed” message is then sent to the person who assigned it.
