Chat

Grommunio also offers a chat feature to make communication easier. You can either send private messages to individual users or post in channels where all members of the channel receive the message. 

On the left-hand side, under Find Channels, you can search for existing channels. By clicking the plus (+) icon, you can add channels or even create a new channel yourself

Further down on the left-hand side, under Direct Messages, you can use the plus (+) icon to search for people, or use Invite Members at the bottom to invite people to the chat.

In the chat itself, you also have the option to send attachments by selecting the paperclip icon. A new window will open where you can choose the file you want to send.
